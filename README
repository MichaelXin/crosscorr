1. Description
==============
This is an implementation of the cross correlation function for images.

It uses OpenCV and there may be implementations with a better performance.
The main purpose is to evaluate how successful this method can be used to 
compare textures against each other in order to find the best match of a
texture for a given plane in 3D reconstructions.

2. Requirements
===============
You need to have a recent version of OpenCV installed. 

3. Compiling
============
You can compile the program by entering the following commands on the command line:

    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake ..
    make
